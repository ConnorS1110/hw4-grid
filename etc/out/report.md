Our repgrids yielded many interesting results, some surprising, others not so surprising. We survey people on 6 movies with 10 attributes. Clustering our examples yielded virtually no differences between the 3 people surveyed. There could be a couple of explanations for this. The first could be that we simply did not have enough examples or diverse enough examples. This seems like a likely possibility since Titanic and Indiana Jones were clustered together, but I think many would agree that those are quite different in terms of descriptive attributes between those 2 movies. It is not shocking that Avatar and Avengers: Endgame were consistently clustered together seeing that they are action films geared towards a teenage audience. Minions being the only dedicated kid’s film, resulted in it always being clustered by itself, so this is not shocking. What may be initially shocking is that Inception and Indiana Jones were not clustered together, with Inception consistently being clustered by itself. Both of these films are similar in the sense that they are somewhat more mature action films, but Indiana Jones was clustered with Titanic. The cause for this would appear to be the scoring of attributes outside of the genre. Attributes such as whether the film is better to be watched at home vs a theater, the setting, and how rewatchable the films are resulted in Indiana Jones and Titanic being clustered together instead of Indiana Jones and Inception. The other major reason we may have seen these results is because we may simply have just chosen people that view these movies different than the general population might. All the people surveyed came from wildly varying cultural backgrounds, which has a large impact on the way these movies are perceived. Had we chosen 3 or more people from a similar cultural background, we may have had different results. Had we had more examples, even more than what was expected for this assignment, we may have been able to better see patterns in the clustering of the examples than we got with the 6 we used.

As for the attribute synonyms, we got more varying results between people. The only consistent result we had was that the attribute sets KidsFilm:AdultsFilm and AnimatedFilm:LiveActionFilm resulted in them being synonyms. This is not surprising. Minions was the only kids movie we included on our list, so it is natural to expect that if a film is animated, it is likely to be a kids film. Had we included other kids films that maybe weren’t animated, this association may not have occurred. From here, results varied quite a bit, but none are particularly shocking. For example, one of the results yielded that WatchAtHomeFilm:WatchInTheaterFilm and LowBudgetFilm:HighBudgetFilm are synonyms. This is not surprising because we would expect if it’s a movie you would want to go and see in a movie theater, it must be a high quality, high budget film, whereas a smaller indie movie, you may just stay at home and rent on your TV. Overall, these were very interesting results and was very eye-opening to see the results clustering yields
