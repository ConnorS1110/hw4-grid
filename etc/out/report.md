# Interview Process
We decided to work with a domain of movies to see if we could find attribute associations between films between people. First, we wanted to focus on choosing a diverse but connectable set of attributes to describe films. We felt 10 attribute sets were necessary to be able to draw meaningful connections between results we had between the 3 people we interviewed. We first wanted to primarily focus on genre, as this is the simplest way to describe a movie. We came up with the attribute sets RomanticFilm:ActionFilm and KidsFilm:AdultsFilm to focus on genre. Then we decided to choose more objective attribute sets so we could see how these attributes are connected (or not) to the more subjective attributes. We came up with attribute sets: ShortFilm:LongFilm, LowBudgetFilm:HighBudgetFilm, SetInPastFilm:SetInFutureFilm, and less so, but still in this category, AnimatedFilm:LiveActionFilm. We felt these were enough objective attributes for us to find connections in the repgrid clustering results we collected. The rest of the subjective attribute sets we came up with rely more heavily on someones personal preference in film that try and capture the other aspects of film not covered by the other attribute sets we created thus far. We ended up with: PlayfulFilm:SuspensefulFilm, WatchItOnceFilm:WatchItManyTimesFile, WatchAtHomeFilm:WatchInTheaterFilm, and the most subjective of all, BadFilm:GoodFilm. We believed these diverse set of attributes would allow us to make meaningful interpretations of our repgrid data.

Then we had to come up with our film examples. This was significantly more challenging than we anticipated. We knew the people we were going to interview were coming from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds, and therefore have very different exposures to film. For example, we were at one point considering including Disney's The Little Mermaid, but we had to exclude this movie because one group member shared that those more classic Disney animated films are not popular in her culture, so it would be hard to get meaningful results from the person she was going to interview. We agreed that Minions was a kid's film that most people are familiar with worldwide. Inception is a film most people know enough about the have opinions on it, with its reputation of being the "movie about dreams". The Indiana Jones series has been an action series staple for many decades now and is something most people are familiar with. We decided to include the series as whole, so as to not be more limiting, and all the films are the same stylistically anyways. Titanic, being one of the highest grossing movies of all time, and how frequently it is used for memes, made this film a good choice as well. Avengers: Endgame was the largest cinematic event of a generation and it is impossible for people to not be familiar with and have opinions about Marvel movies at this point. Avatar also being the highest grossing movie of all time and recently being thrust back into the limelight with the recent release of the sequel also made this film a sensible choice.

With our attributes and examples set, we each surveyed one person and this was our data:<br>
Person 1 - [[Repgrid](https://github.com/ConnorS1110/hw4-grid/blob/main/etc/data/repgrid_ashvin.json)] [[Cluster Result](https://github.com/ConnorS1110/hw4-grid/blob/main/etc/out/ashvin_repgrid.out)]<br>
Person 2 - [[Repgrid](https://github.com/ConnorS1110/hw4-grid/blob/main/etc/data/repgrid_cynthia.json)] [[Cluster Result](https://github.com/ConnorS1110/hw4-grid/blob/main/etc/out/cynthia_repgrid.out)]<br>

# Analysis of Results
Our repgrids yielded many interesting results, some surprising, others not so surprising. We survey people on 6 movies with 10 attributes. Clustering our examples yielded virtually no differences between the 3 people surveyed. There could be a couple of explanations for this. The first could be that we simply did not have enough examples or diverse enough examples. This seems like a likely possibility since Titanic and Indiana Jones were clustered together, but I think many would agree that those are quite different in terms of descriptive attributes between those 2 movies. It is not shocking that Avatar and Avengers: Endgame were consistently clustered together seeing that they are action films geared towards a teenage audience. Minions being the only dedicated kid’s film, resulted in it always being clustered by itself, so this is not shocking. What may be initially shocking is that Inception and Indiana Jones were not clustered together, with Inception consistently being clustered by itself. Both of these films are similar in the sense that they are somewhat more mature action films, but Indiana Jones was clustered with Titanic. The cause for this would appear to be the scoring of attributes outside of the genre. Attributes such as whether the film is better to be watched at home vs a theater, the setting, and how rewatchable the films are resulted in Indiana Jones and Titanic being clustered together instead of Indiana Jones and Inception. The other major reason we may have seen these results is because we may simply have just chosen people that view these movies different than the general population might. All the people surveyed came from wildly varying cultural backgrounds, which has a large impact on the way these movies are perceived. Had we chosen 3 or more people from a similar cultural background, we may have had different results. Had we had more examples, even more than what was expected for this assignment, we may have been able to better see patterns in the clustering of the examples than we got with the 6 we used.

As for the attribute synonyms, we got more varying results between people. The only consistent result we had was that the attribute sets KidsFilm:AdultsFilm and AnimatedFilm:LiveActionFilm resulted in them being synonyms. This is not surprising. Minions was the only kids movie we included on our list, so it is natural to expect that if a film is animated, it is likely to be a kids film. Had we included other kids films that maybe weren’t animated, this association may not have occurred. From here, results varied quite a bit, but none are particularly shocking. For example, one of the results yielded that WatchAtHomeFilm:WatchInTheaterFilm and LowBudgetFilm:HighBudgetFilm are synonyms. This is not surprising because we would expect if it’s a movie you would want to go and see in a movie theater, it must be a high quality, high budget film, whereas a smaller indie movie, you may just stay at home and rent on your TV. Overall, these were very interesting results and was very eye-opening to see the results clustering yields
